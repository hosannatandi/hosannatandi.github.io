            Born in Spain, Salvador Dalí was a surrealist icon. He showed advanced artistic skill at an early age,
            and his parents supported his artistic endeavors. They sent him to art schools, although he was a problematic student.
            His first public exhibition was at just 15 years old. His wife Elena Dmitrievna Diakonova took care of the business side of being an artist.
